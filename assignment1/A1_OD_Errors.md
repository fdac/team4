  Audris asked us to create a list of operational data errors in the data that we analyzed for Assignment 1. We'll be presenting our findings Monday in class.
</p>
<p>
  Some common errors to look for are located in his <a href="https://github.com/fdac/presentations">prelim.pdf</a> presentation. 
  Feel free to add to the list.

  Common Errors:
  <ul>- The Gutenburg books include lengthy licenses, which should not be accounted for in the analysis</ul>
  <ul>- Books written in different eras</ul>
  <ul>- Books of differing genres</ul>
  <ul>- Partial/Incomplete Books (ex. missing chapters)</ul>
  <ul>- Incorrect translations</ul>
  <ul>- Whether words with punctuation in them count as the same word as the version without punctuation changes results</ul>
</p>
